Please include in this folder the downloaded T-REKS file and IUPRED script. T-REKS is available to download [here](https://bioinfo.crbm.cnrs.fr/index.php?route=tools&tool=3). It requires muscle v3, which can be downloaded and installed by following the instructions [here](https://drive5.com/muscle/downloads_v3.htm) (Alternatively clustal can be used, whereby the lib/analyse_testing_data.sh has to be adapted accordingly). IUPRED is available to download [here](https://iupred2a.elte.hu/download_new).<br>
