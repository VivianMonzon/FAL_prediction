Please include in this folder the downloaded T-REKS file and IUPRED script. T-REKS is available to download [here](https://bioinfo.crbm.cnrs.fr/index.php?route=tools&tool=3). It requires muscle v3, which can be downloaded and installed by following the instructions [here](https://drive5.com/muscle/downloads_v3.htm) (Alternatively clustal can be used, whereby the lib/analyse_testing_data.sh has to be adapted accordingly). IUPRED is available to download [here](https://iupred2a.elte.hu/download_new).<br>
Within the downloaded iupred2 folder, you will find a python script names 'iupred2a.py', which must be included in this folder, and an additional data folder. Uploading the whole data folder on colab requires time. Therefore, I recommand uploaded only the files **long_histogram** and **iupred2_long_energy_matrix** to the provided data/ folder you can find in this directory.
