In the [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/VivianMonzon/FAL_prediction/blob/main/Colab/ML_FA_prediction.ipynb) please include in this folder the downloaded **iupred2a.py** script file from IUPRED. IUPRED is available to download [here](https://iupred2a.elte.hu/download_new).<br>
Within the downloaded iupred2 folder, you will find a python script names **iupred2a.py**, which must be included in this folder, and an additional data folder. Uploading the whole data folder on colab requires time. Therefore, I recommand to upload only the files **long_histogram** and **iupred2_long_energy_matrix** to the provided 'data/' folder you can find in this 'scripts/' directory.
