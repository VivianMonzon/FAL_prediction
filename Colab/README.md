Unfornuately, the external used scripts need to be downloaded and and again uploaded to the colab notebook by the user. Please download T-REKS [here](https://bioinfo.crbm.cnrs.fr/index.php?route=tools&tool=3). This time muscle doesn't need to be downloaded as this is done in the notebook.  IUPRED is available to download [here](https://iupred2a.elte.hu/download_new).<br>
Please upload on colab the downloaded T-REKS file into the script folder. <br>
Within the downloaded iupred2 folder, you will find a python script names 'iupred2a.py', which must be included in this folder, and an additional data folder. Uploading the whole data folder on colab requires time. Therefore, I recommand uploaded only the files **long_histogram** and **iupred2_long_energy_matrix** to the provided data/ folder you can find in this directory.
