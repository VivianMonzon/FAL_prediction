Unfornuately, in order to use the colab notebook, IUPRED needs to be downloaded manually as it is only available to academic users. IUPRED is available to download [here](https://iupred2a.elte.hu/download_new). <br>
Within the downloaded iupred2 folder, you will find a python script named 'iupred2a.py' and an additional data folder. Please upload the 'iupred2a.py' file in the 'scripts' folder. Uploading the whole data folder on colab requires time. Therefore, I recommand to upload only the files **long_histogram** and **iupred2_long_energy_matrix** files of the data folder to the provided 'scripts/data/' folder in the [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/VivianMonzon/FAL_prediction/blob/main/Colab/ML_FA_prediction.ipynb).
